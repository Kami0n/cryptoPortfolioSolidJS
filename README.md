# Crypto Portfolio web app created in SolidJS




## How to develop in SolidJS

At the beggining in the project directory run:
`npm install`
 
After that run:
`npm dev` or `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
App is accessible on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.<br>

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes, after that the app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any web hosting.
